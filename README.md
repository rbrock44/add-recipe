## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This is a server side single-page angular frontend created to asssit in taking a recipe and turn it into JSON format for my main [family recipe website](https://family-recipes.ryan-brock.com/). After clicking 'Save Recipe' the JSON version is copied to clipboard and should be messaged to me (Ryan - rbrock444@gmail.com). Automation is in the works <br/>
